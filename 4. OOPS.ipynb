    "The four pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Encapsulation: It refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and methods that operate on that data into a single unit called a class. Encapsulation hides the internal state of objects and restricts direct access to them from outside the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Abstraction: Abstraction involves hiding the complex implementation details of a class and showing only the essential features of the object. It allows users to interact with objects at a higher level of abstraction without needing to understand their internal workings.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism by which a new class (subclass) can inherit properties and behaviors from an existing class (superclass). It promotes code reuse and establishes a hierarchy of classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables a single interface to be used for entities of different types and ensures that the correct method is called based on the object's type or class."
